import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import blankTemplate from '../../../assets/images/each-1-blank.png';
import filledOutput from '../../../assets/images/each-2.png';

This guide takes you from zero to a working Excel report in about 5 minutes.

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/javajack/xlfill
```

Requires Go 1.24+. Only `.xlsx` files are supported.

## Step 1: Create your template

Open Excel, Google Sheets, or LibreOffice Calc. Create a new file and set it up like this:

<Image src={blankTemplate} alt="A blank Excel template with expression placeholders in cells and a jx:each command in a cell comment" />

Here's what to do:

1. **Format the header row** — bold text, background color, borders, whatever you like
2. **In the data row**, put expressions: `${e.Name}` in A2, `${e.Age}` in B2, `${e.Payment}` in C2
3. **Right-click cell A1** and add a cell comment with this text:
   ```
   jx:area(lastCell="C2")
   jx:each(items="employees" var="e" lastCell="C2")
   ```
4. Save as `template.xlsx`

That comment tells XLFill: *"The template region is A1:C2. Repeat row 2 for each item in the `employees` list, using `e` as the loop variable."*

:::tip
The header row (row 1) is part of the area but **above** the `jx:each` row, so it appears once. Only the `jx:each` row (row 2) repeats.
:::

### How to add cell comments in your spreadsheet editor

Cell comments are the mechanism XLFill uses to read commands. Here's how to add them in the most popular tools:

#### Microsoft Excel

1. Right-click the cell (e.g., A1)
2. Select **Insert Comment** (or **New Note** in Excel 365)
3. Type your commands, one per line:
   ```
   jx:area(lastCell="C2")
   jx:each(items="employees" var="e" lastCell="C2")
   ```
4. Click outside the comment to close it

:::note
Excel 365 has two features: **Comments** (threaded, collaborative) and **Notes** (classic yellow sticky notes). XLFill reads **Notes**. If you only see "New Comment" (threaded), go to **Review > Notes > New Note** instead.
:::

#### Google Sheets

1. Right-click the cell
2. Select **Insert note** (not "Insert comment" — that creates a threaded discussion)
3. Type your commands and click outside to save
4. **Important**: When done, download as **Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)** via File > Download. XLFill only reads `.xlsx` files.

:::caution
Google Sheets distinguishes between **Notes** (plain text, stored in the cell) and **Comments** (threaded discussions). XLFill reads **Notes**. Use **Insert > Note**, not **Insert > Comment**.
:::

#### LibreOffice Calc

1. Right-click the cell
2. Select **Insert Comment**
3. Type your commands in the yellow comment box
4. Click outside to close
5. Save as `.xlsx` format (File > Save As > select "Microsoft Excel 2007-365 (.xlsx)")

#### WPS Office Spreadsheet

1. Right-click the cell
2. Select **Insert Comment**
3. Type your commands in the comment box
4. Click outside to close
5. Ensure you save as `.xlsx` format

#### Quick verification

After adding comments, you should see a small **red triangle** in the top-right corner of the cell (in most editors). Hover over the cell to verify your comment text is correct. That's all XLFill needs to find your commands.

## Step 2: Write Go code

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/javajack/xlfill"
)

func main() {
    data := map[string]any{
        "employees": []map[string]any{
            {"Name": "Elsa",  "Age": 28, "Payment": 1500},
            {"Name": "Oleg",  "Age": 32, "Payment": 2300},
            {"Name": "Neil",  "Age": 34, "Payment": 2500},
            {"Name": "Maria", "Age": 25, "Payment": 1700},
            {"Name": "John",  "Age": 35, "Payment": 2800},
        },
    }

    err := xlfill.Fill("template.xlsx", "output.xlsx", data)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Println("Done! Open output.xlsx")
}
```

## Step 3: Run it

```bash
go run main.go
```

Open `output.xlsx`:

<Image src={filledOutput} alt="The filled output Excel file with 5 employee rows, all formatting preserved from the template" />

Five rows of data, all formatting preserved from the template. The header stayed put, the borders carried over, the number formats are intact. No code for any of that.

## Using Go structs

Maps work, but so do structs — use whatever fits your application:

```go
type Employee struct {
    Name    string
    Age     int
    Payment float64
}

data := map[string]any{
    "employees": []Employee{
        {Name: "Elsa", Age: 28, Payment: 1500},
        {Name: "Oleg", Age: 32, Payment: 2300},
    },
}

xlfill.Fill("template.xlsx", "output.xlsx", data)
```

Field names in expressions (`${e.Name}`) match struct field names.

## Serving from an HTTP handler

For web applications, use `FillReader` or `FillBytes`:

```go
func reportHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    data := fetchReportData()

    w.Header().Set("Content-Type",
        "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet")
    w.Header().Set("Content-Disposition",
        "attachment; filename=report.xlsx")

    tmpl, _ := os.Open("template.xlsx")
    defer tmpl.Close()

    xlfill.FillReader(tmpl, w, data)
}
```

No temp files. The report streams directly to the HTTP response.

## What just happened?

Let's recap the workflow:

1. You designed a template **visually in Excel** — formatting, fonts, borders, all done in a spreadsheet editor
2. You added **two things** to the template: `${...}` expressions in cells and a `jx:` command in a cell comment
3. Your Go code provided data and called **one function**
4. XLFill read the template, found the commands, looped over your data, evaluated the expressions, and wrote the output — **preserving every visual detail**

The template is the design. The code is just data. That's the whole philosophy.

## Next: understand how templates work

Now that you've seen it in action, let's look deeper at how templates are structured — what the `jx:area` command does, how nesting works, and how XLFill processes your template.
